This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Using classnames library to toggle classes
classnames is a simple library that lets you toggle class names easily. You can install it using npm install classnames or yarn add classnames.

Please take a look at its documentation for more details, but here's the basic usage:

Suppose that you want to create an Alert component which accepts type, which can be 'success' or 'error'.
If it's 'success', you want the text color to be green. If it's 'error', you want the text color to be red.
You can first write a CSS module (e.g. alert.module.css) like this:

.success {
  color: green;
}
.error {
  color: red;
}
